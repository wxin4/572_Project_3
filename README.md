## Setup
Before running this project, here are some IMPORTANT NOTES:
* The only trained data is in the MealData folder.
* The Test folder contains the test data from Project 2 and the result.csv file is based on that.
* Please only replace the test data inside the Test folder so that the testingData.py will work correctly.
* There are three .pkl files created while running the trainingData.py file for later testing use.
* There are three graphs created when training the dataset and they are SSE values, KMeans clusters, and DBSCAN clusters.
* For KMeans, I have shown each of the cluster's SSE and Accuracy values. I also did the same thing on DBSCAN.

##### Note: Run this project using PyCharm will be the best.
